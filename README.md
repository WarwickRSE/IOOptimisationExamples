# IOOptimisationExamples

These are the code files associated with the demonstrations
in the Warwick Scientific Computing RSE workshop on
optimising data flows for HPC.

Under the MachineLearningExample directory you will
find some (quick) ML examples showing a few options
for reducing the number of files in an ML workflow.

## Useful Module commands

For the examples above, you will need to load the following modules:

For using the HDF5-as-a-filesystem tool via the Sulis module system you will need:
`ml GCC/11.3.0 H5VFS Szip/2.1.1`
